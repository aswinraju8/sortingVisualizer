## 🧠 README: Sorting Visualizer (Python + Pygame)

### 🎯 Project Overview

This **Sorting Visualizer** is an interactive tool built using **Python and Pygame** to help visualize how popular sorting algorithms work in real-time.
It provides an intuitive graphical representation of how elements are swapped and compared during sorting, allowing users to observe the behavior and efficiency of each algorithm visually.

### 🚀 Features

✅ Real-time visualization of sorting algorithms
✅ Supports **Ascending** and **Descending** order sorting
✅ Keyboard controls for switching algorithms and resetting the data
✅ Smooth animations using **Pygame**
✅ Algorithms implemented:

* **Bubble Sort**
* **Insertion Sort**
* **Selection Sort**

### 🧩 Controls

| Key              | Action                                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **R**            | Reset the list with new random values      |
| **S**            | Start sorting using the selected algorithm |
| **A**            | Sort in ascending order                    |
| **D**            | Sort in descending order                   |
| **B**            | Choose Bubble Sort                         |
| **I**            | Choose Insertion Sort                      |
| **T**            | Choose Selection Sort                      |
| **Close Window** | Exit the visualizer                        |

### 🖥️ Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have:

* **Python 3.8+**
* **Pygame**

---

### ⚙️ Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/sorting-visualizer.git
   cd sorting-visualizer
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

3. **Run the visualizer:**

   ```bash
   python sorting_visualizer.py
   ```

---

### 🎨 How It Works

* A list of random integers is generated.
* Each integer is represented as a vertical bar whose height corresponds to its value.
* During sorting:

  * **Green** bars indicate elements being compared.
  * **Red** bars indicate elements being swapped.
* The screen updates dynamically to show progress through each iteration of the sorting algorithm.

---

### 🧠 Future Enhancements

* Add more algorithms (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort)
* Add speed control for visualization
* Add color schemes or dark mode
* Display time complexity for each algorithm
* Add a menu interface for easier selection
